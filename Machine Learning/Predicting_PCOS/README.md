# PCOS Prediction 

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a reproductive condition that impacts 1 in 10 women of childbearing age. Even though the effects of the condition are well-documented, the underlying cause remains a medical mystery.
This project, created in R, employs decision trees in an effort to determine which factors are most likely to contribute to an outcome of a woman in her 20s - 40s being diagnosed with PCOS.
