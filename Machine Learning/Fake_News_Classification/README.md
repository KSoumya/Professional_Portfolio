# Fake News Classification

This was a final project for my data mining course that combined my ability to construct data pipelines and my existing journalistic abilities to discern news reliability. I assessed the efficacy and performance of four different classifiers on accurately classifying a news story as real or fake, given a predetermined label. I used two text vectorizers, count vectorizer and TF-IDF. For classifiers I used Naive Bayes, support vector machine, passive aggressive classifier, 
and linear regression.
