# TensorFlow Mask Detection

Facial recognition, an already complex science, faces an additional challenge: The introduction of masks to society. It is now even more difficult for facial recognition AI to 
discern between individuals. Therefore, this project sought to apply a convolutional neural net (CNN) to determine whether it was possible to train a model to distinguish between
a set of photos displaying masked and unmasked faces.
