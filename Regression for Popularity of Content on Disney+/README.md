# Regression for Popularity of Content on Disney+ 

This was one of my first predictive analytic projects in my data science master's program. Using available streaming data, I sought to determine which content type was more popular on 
Disney +: Original content or so-called Disney classics? I created linear models, conducted correlation tests and assessed p-values and other stastical measures to arrive at my 
conclusion and recommendations for further business strategies.
