# Predicting Student Debt Default

The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated an already vexxing student debt problem. With massive layoffs at some of the nation's largest companies, adults attending college as part of a
company-sponsored program are losing their education benefits along with their jobs. These individuals now face a tough decision: Do they pay for school out of pocket and incur debt?
Or, do they forgo education altogether? This project applies both linear regression and classification and regression trees (CART) to determine what factors predict whether or not
a student will default on student loan debt.
