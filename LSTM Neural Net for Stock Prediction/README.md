# LSTM Neural Net for Stock Prediction

I hand-selected an index of stocks that generated better-than-anticipated returns during the COVID-19 pandemic. These included corporate giants such as Walmart and newcomers like
Zoom. For the first portion of the project I applied linear regression to conduct a basic prediction. Then for the highest performing stocks, I constructed a long short-term memory
neural net to forecast stock prices past 30 days in the future. The models were typically reliable within 20-30 days but faltered after more than a month.
