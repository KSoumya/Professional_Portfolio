# Variational Autoencoder 

This project was adapted from a big data course assignment. Using a TensorFlow tutorial as a guide, I developed, tested and implemented a variational autoencoder on the MNIST image data set. 
My model draws the numbers included in the data set and displays them on a 15 x 15 grid.
